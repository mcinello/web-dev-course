HTML 5 NOTES
find HTML in chrome - right click and "view pagesource"
<body> where the info of a page is
<div> divides the information in sections
<p> for normal text
< > tags only in html
<title> shows up at the op of the browser
<h> only goes up to 6; if we try 7, it will give us regular text
	using key words in h1 tag will be more likely to pop up in google searches
<p> doesn't restyle texts; used to manually put lines in between texts
	1) use the tags on each line - do this if there's different formatting for each line
	2)in between <p> can put a line break <br> to create new line, but there's no space in between
		br self-closing tag - could be <br /> for xhtml
Bold is <b> but encouraged to use <strong> because it's easier to read
Italic is <i> or <em> (for emphasis)
Underline is <u> or <ins> (for inserted)
<sup> superscript
<sub> subscript
<del> is for strike out text aka deleted text
<hr> self closing; may need <hr /> for xhtml

		type="submit">
		
		value="" customizes text in box
				Can add value= to any of the inputs to customize text
				adding value to radio can see in code which has been selected
