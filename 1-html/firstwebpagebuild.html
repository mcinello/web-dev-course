		<h3>Why I want to start coding</h3>

		<p id="top">This is my first webpage I am building from scratch. <br />
		I am interested in this course because I want to learn how to customize my website. <br />
		I want to share the knowledge that has helped me throughout the years to those looking for answers as well.<br />
		I also wish to pursue a computer tech career alongside my boyfriend, who has had a passion in programming since he was in elementary school.</p>

			<h3>My Inspirations</h3>

		<p>I was inspired from various bloggers and youtubers to start my own site. here's a video reference below of <strong>Shameless Maya</strong>:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>beauty</li>
				<li>health</li>
				<li>lifestyle</li>
				<li>tech</li>
				<li>fashion</li>
			</ul>
