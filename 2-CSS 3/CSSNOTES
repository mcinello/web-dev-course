CASCADING STYLE SHEET - CSS
<p style="color:blue;font-size:50%"
	This styling is not recommended
		hard to read
		difficult to maintain
		linked to a specific <p>
		Solution is Interal CSS
INTERNAL CSS
	<style></style>
		traditional to put it inside <head></head> section
	<style type="text/css">
	p {}
		list what you want related to p
			eg. color, size
CLASSES
want to change the different sentences in the p
	<p class="red">
		.red
		{

		}
	class= can contain more than 1 type"text/csselement
		<p class="red large">
IDs
	<p id="green"

	#green {

	}

	id should only be used once per page
	class can be used more than once
styling text within a p tag
	<span></span>
DIVs
division - a group of HTML elements

COLOR
	eg. color:
	 background-color:
can use HTML Color Codes
	#FFFFFF

FLOATING
	positioning the divs
	everything floated left will be aligned to left of the screen
	left is default
Combining elements that are floated vs. elements not floated
	anything not floated will put itself in the "flow" of the page
		subject to change when browser size changes
	clear:both;
		so it doesn't "float" between the divs
POSITIONING
	more precise than floating
	position: relative;
		position it where it defaults
		needed before every specific positioning
		creating a type of margin
			left: 100pc - moves to right, creates margin on left
			left: -50px will move it to the left
			top:
	z-index: helps with overlapping elements
		the higher number will layer on top
	opactiy - bigger the number, less see-through it is
		creates a fade/transparent look in the div
	position: absolute;
		2nd div will go behind the 1st div
		takes the object out of flow of the page
		2nd div will begin where 1st div is cause it won't be considered
		if you want to position it over the top of everything else
	position: fixed;
		different from absolute
		absolute will move when page is scrolled
		fix will not let the div move even as you scroll down the page
	relative an move element relative to where it would other wise be
	abs takes element out off flow of the page allows to move around relative to top left of the page
	fixed keeps element in place 
	all 3 can use left and top to move it
	opacity change see-thru of object
	z-index for what goes in front

	PADDING
	Implementing space within the div even after you set the with
	Websites have default settings, may need to set the padding, margin and p tags
	eg. body
	{
		margin: 0;
		padding: 0;
	}

BORDERS
border: pixel color solid

border-style : ridge solid dotted dashed;
border-color
border-width

could be very specific and do:
eg. border-left-style

border-radius adds a radius to edge of square - it makes it more circular than a square.


	set border-radius px to half of the div (eg. 50px) will make it perfectly circular
		2 ways to do it:
		50px - based on half of the div px
		50% - will automatically do it


	FONTS

	font-famly egs
		cursive
		fantasy
		inherit
		monospace
		sans-serif
		serif

Google Fonts
	repository of a huge number of fonts used and hosted
	lots of flexibility

STYLING TEXT

Main types of styling to be used:
font-weight for bold
font-style for italic
text-decoration for underline
text-decoration: none; for no underline of links

a:hover - styling a link in a certain condition (ie when it's hovered)
a:hover
{
	text-decoration: underline;
	color: green;
}

ALIGNING TEXT
text-align: right; will align the text to the right eg. the "parent element"
	 "parent element" setting the <p> tag in just the body of the page or within a div
	text-align: justify;
		stretches the text to the end of the page

Lorem Ipsum
	 handy page for creating latin text (usually the generic thing used)


STYLING LINKS
to make sure there's only a line when you hover over the link:
a
	{ text-decoration: none;
	 }

a:hover {
	text-decoration: underline;
}

a:visited (links you already clicked)
{
	color: green;
}
